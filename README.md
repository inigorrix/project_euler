# Project Euler Solutions in Julia

Welcome to my Project Euler solutions repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, implemented in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/). The aim is to solve challenging mathematical and computational problems while learning and honing my skills in Julia.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a collection of problems designed to be solved with a mix of mathematical insight and programming. It provides a fantastic opportunity to:

- Practice algorithms and problem-solving.
- Explore mathematical concepts.
- Improve programming efficiency.

## Why Julia?

Julia is a high-level, high-performance programming language for technical computing. It's particularly well-suited for numerical and scientific computing, making it a great choice for tackling Project Euler problems.

## Repository Structure

Each solution is saved in its own file, named according to the problem number:
